# Sorting

## Analysis of any algorithm
1) Correctness of algorithm
-   means it should produce desired output
2)  efficiency a) Time and b) Space

-   Time complexity depends on input provided
-   we will ignore system contrains

## How to measure the running time ?
-   Number of basic operations in a high level language

Below two operations dominate the running time
a) Comarision operations. ex: If
b) Exchange/swap operations.


Brute Force
-   Selection Sort
-   Bubble Sort

## Selection Sort
-   Every time find the smallest element and place at the correct position from beginning
- So every i-th iteration ith small element will be placed at i-th position
- Time complexity  O(N^2)
- Space Complexity O(N)

## BUbble sort
- Time complexity  O(N^2)

Decrease & Conquer
-   In this approach problem can be solved either by recursive or iterative

## Insertion Sort


Divide and Conquer
